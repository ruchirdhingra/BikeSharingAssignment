# Bike Sharing Assignment
> The objective of this assigment is to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes, in order to understand the drivers of demand as well as the effect size of these drivers It also contains the PDF containing the answers to the subjective questions asked as part of the assignment

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the pandemic.
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.
- So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- The objective is to determine variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes, as well as measuring the effect size of those variables
- The model will be used to understand the demand dynamics of new markets and mould the business strategy accordingly
- The dataset consists of bike daily bike rentals from 2018 and 2019, along with useful information such as temperature, weather, humidity, etc.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature has the largest effect on rentals (positive - higher temperatures correlate with higher rentals)
- Snow/Rain seems to have a large negative effect on rentals, while misty or cloudy weather also has a negative effect, but much smaller in size
- There is also a growth factor with time - one can anticipate higher demand in the secind year post launch as compared to first
- Windspeed and humidity also have a moderate negative effect on rentals
- Spring has the lowest demand by far, with summer and fall having the highest
